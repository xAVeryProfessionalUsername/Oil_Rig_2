Hey, it's me 2 years in the future, this project is crap.

Price change over 5 months based off of price target.

Correlation: -.32: (Weak downard trend, strong trend in Stock world)
P-Value: Essentially zero(10^-74)(Definitely significant)



Notes:

Pre-Hypothesis: Stocks are based off of investor sentiment; when people see a stock as good, investors will invest in it, like Gamestop and Bitcoin hypes.

End price taken in Dec 20, 2021, stock prices dropped 5 percent within 2 weeks as result of fears of intrest rate raises. Period 2 weeks before period stated was also in a volatile state.(As per SP500).

Sample size around 3000.

Average gain of all stocks was -11%. SP500 gain over same time period was 4%. Difference probably just result of growing companies taking up larger share of index and vice versa for smaller companies.

Only one sample was taken. Stock market tendencies vary heavily time by time.

Companies with stock splits removed from sample.

Post-Hypothesis: Very high price targets could result in hype dissapointments and therefore panic selling therefore lower prices.
